# Overview
- Mini project to analyze whether variance (volatility) is higher on earnings days compared to non-earnings days, for two random subsets of stocks
- Found that 89% and 91% of the Utility and Staple stocks sampled had significant p-values, indicating return variance tends to be greater on earnings days than non-earnings days
